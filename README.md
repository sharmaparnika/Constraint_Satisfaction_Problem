# Constraint Satisfaction Problem

#### AIM: To solve Crypt arithmetic problem in Python - Constrain and Satisfaction Problem

#### ALGORITHM:
•	Step 1: The first step is to identify the variables. In this case, out variables are all the letters in the problem. They are:
C, P, I, S, F, U, N, T, R, E

•	Step 2: Then we identify the constraints
The variables are letter and can take on single digit value
Therefore, we can establish the following constraints
CP + IS + FUN = TRUE
each of the letter must be a different digit
C, I, F, T ≠ 0 (since leading digit in a number is not zero)

•	Step 3: Printing all Solutions
We want the solver to print the solution as it finds them.

•	Step 4: Invoke the Solver and call the printer.
